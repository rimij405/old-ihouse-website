This is an impromptu staging area before we push this bad boy to production.

## What's held here?

This is the home website (a work-in-progress) for RIT's International House.

I'd link you to a page explaining more but I'm afraid this will have to do.

You can find more info about the **Rochester Institute of Technology** [here](https://www.rit.edu). 

## Who can we blame for this mess?

Currently this is run by the two Webmasters:

  Jason Carr [[@jasoncarr0](https://www.github.com/jasoncarr0)] - International House Webmaster 2015 - 2016
  
  Ian Effendi [[@rimij405](http://www.twitter.com/rimij405)] - International House Public Relations Officer and Webmaster 2016 - Present
  
## What is International House?

I-House is one of RIT's seven Special Interest Houses (SIHs) on campus.
Think of themed housing; this is one that specializes in international cultures.

We like cooking. We have a kitchen.

And we are notorious for having poorly maintained websites.

That ends today.

## Can I contribute?

Nope. Sorry.
Unless you've got the position of Webmaster we can't let you near this. Thanks for offering though!
